# How to setup the environment

Fist of all you will need to install python 3.9 and pip.
If you already have these, then follow the instructions

- `pip install pipenv` : This will download the package manager to your computer
- `pipenv shell` : Starts the virtual environment
- `pipenv install` : This will install everything you need to play around here 
- `python main.py` : Run this on the root directory to execute the tests

# How to add new functions

- Create a new folder with the name that you think it's good
- Create a file that contains the functions that will be imported
> usually those are the random generator and the seed start setter.
